# wolf killer console based game
Here I has developed an simple console based game named "Wolf Killer" in c++ programming language.

Game instructions
The game heart is based on voting system.

There are total 7 players in the game.
These 7 players are  divided into two teams.
1. evil team and 2.Good team

Here all the seven players has an right to vote on the bases of voting the player will be killed.for eg.player 1 got max vote and
he will be killed. now he can't vote because he is dead now.

By doing this at last all the enemies must die to win the game for good team.otherwise Evil team will win.

Play the game and best of luck that you will win.
